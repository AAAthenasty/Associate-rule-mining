# Associate-rule-mining
A method to discover associate relationship between items under supermarket situation

## Motivation

This is a homework for the Instruction To Data Science class, the teacher asked us to design a way to get the relationship between two items.

## Instruction
There are two ways to get the relationship, the [first](https://github.com/AAAthenasty/Associate-rule-mining/blob/master/First_method.ipynb) one was given by the teacher which used dictionary structure to store the result , the  [second](https://github.com/AAAthenasty/Associate-rule-mining/blob/master/Second_Method.ipynb) one was created by myself which is faster even than the first one dealing with large dataset, using dataframe to deal with the problem.

## Packages
Only pandas, time are used 

## Addinng Information
There are also other ways to deal with this problem, e.g Aporior algorithm
